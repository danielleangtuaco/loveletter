    </section>
        <div class="p">
            <p> Love is such a simple and short word yet it can embody so much feelings. To each person, love can mean many things and can take on many forms. Love is said to be patient, kind, not envious, not boastful and not proud. Love is all these things and sometimes not. Love is confusing for it can be mistaken for many things. Love is an itense feeling which will never be able to put into words. In my existence, love has evolved and changed from childhood to present and saw that love can change a person. It has healed broken hearts which was thought to be beyond repairable and has shattered happy hearts. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have always believed in the fairytale happy endings and saw love as something magical but as I grew older, I realized that love is not all smiles and sunshine. Like all great things, love comes with pain. Despite the pain that I have felt before, I still choose to believe that true love will someday find its way to me.

        <h2> Envy</h2>
    </section>
        <div class="p">
            <p> Walking the streets alone, I see couples with hands entwined. I can't help but see them touch and miss the warmth of somebody's heart next to mine. I want somebody to be there for me, even just in existence. I know that love can come in many ways. Love is not just limited to romantic love but I  am selfish. I will always want something that I cannot have. I see people having someone for them. How can I miss something I have not yet experienced?

            You made me happy again and for that I am grateful. You made me realize there was more to life. I guess it is true that people say that only the same love that hurt you can heal you completely. With you, I felt like love really can happen. With you, I seemed to realize what it felt like to be loved, appreciated, and most of all BEAUTIFUL. I thought that the promises you gave would become true eventually but I was wrong. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Promises are made to be broken by you. You told me you loved me yet you replaced me so easily. You said you'd wait forever. I guess forever isn't as long as I'd hope it would be. Like the cold breeze passing a hot dessert, it was too good to be true and like the breeze you passed too quickly. It was as if you were the one thing I never knew I was missing. I should have listened to myself when I felt that something wasn't sincere about you but instead I took the advice of people close to me. I wanted you to prove me wrong instead you proved my paranoid thoughts true. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I regret opening up to you like I did but I don't regret meeting you. I have learned so much. I didn't think that a person could give as much affection as you did at first but you opened my eyes to the love that I deserve. You gave me hope. We may not have ended up together but I think that we were never really meant to be. You were supposed to be a lesson and you came to me at the right time. I miss you but I know that that person doesn't exist. He was only a person you wanted me to think of you.
